# Tartana Users

Tartana has a simple user management. No fancy ACL or whatever. Per default a user is installed with *admin* as username *admin* as password. To change the password or create more users you need a SSH console. The following interactive commands are available to manage the users:

- **fos:user:create**

  Creates a new user.

- **fos:user:change-password**

  Changes the password for the user.

- **fos:user:deactivate**

  Deactivates the user.
