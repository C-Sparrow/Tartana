Open source PHP app which manages downloads for you on any PHP capable device (Raspberry Pi up to big servers). It supports link decryption as well as all important container formats like dlc and automatic file extraction. It just works and makes fun!

## Features
- Runs on a simple low resource [environment](doc/main/requirements.md)
- Modern architecture with support for PHP 5.5 up to 7 and HHVM.
- Premium account support.
- Runs in [different modes](doc/main/running.md): command line, an existing web server infrastructure or as standalone web server.
